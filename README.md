# Traffic Violation Management App

#### Project status: 
### SOON TO BE DELIVERED


## Get Started
To begin with, check the installation guide of [React Native Development Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

After following the instructions and making sure everything works fine, we may now proceed to the next step.

## Installation 

Clone the repository in git [Traffic Violation Management App](https://github.com/Tordx/traffic-violation-management-app.git)


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Tordx/traffic-violation-management-app.git
```

Run [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) as Administrator and direct to your repository folder.

Make sure to install all its dependency by running install.

```bash
$ yarn install
```
Clean android gradle by going to android folder and running command:

```bash
$ cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd..
```

## Start Coding

Make sure you are running the Emulator with SDKVersion 29, preferably Pixel C.

Run your code using the same [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) by running this command:

```bash
$ npx react-native run-android
```
or
```bash
$ yarn run android
```

if [yarn run android](https://yarnpkg.com/) is not recognized by your CLI, in most cases it is because of role permissions. In this case, you may run this command:
```bash
$ set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

if issue persist, check related issues at stackoverflow or github community forum.
